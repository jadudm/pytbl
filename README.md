# tbl

I have been exploring how we work with data for some time. Last year, I took a first pass at this with the Racket library [tbl](https://bitbucket.org/jadudm/tbl/src/master/). In the README for that library, I wrote:

> I often find myself introducing students to the design of programs. I also gravitate towards the pedagogy (and sometimes the tools) espoused in [How to Design Programs](https://htdp.org/). I also do work with environmental sensing and physical computing (often around the computational intersection of dance and music), and like to engage students with studying the world they live in, and in doing so, collect, analyze, and work to understand that data.

This is a reworking of those ideas into Python. I am [blogging the rewrite step-by-step](http://jadud.com/), and therefore taking time to explore principles of programming that might be of interest to learners. When I am done, I believe I will have a library that provides a simplified interface for working with interesting data that helps novices get into the world of data analytics and data science.
